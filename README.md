# Code-quiz
This timed coding quiz was created as a project for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript implementing new concepts about Web API's that were learned in week 4 of the UNC Coding Bootcamp.

## Usage

This quiz can also be downloaded through its files in the Github repository at this link:

In order to access and edit the files, it is recommended to install VS Code or a similar application.

## Instructions
On the quiz's start screen, there will be a link on the top right that says "View Highscores" in which the user can view all the highscores. There will also be a name and description of the quiz. The start button below the quiz will initiate the quiz to start.

Once the quiz starts, there will be a series of questions and a timer that starts at 60 seconds. If the user fails to answer the question correctly, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. The game ends either when: all questions are answered or when the timer is at 0. The "score" is the number on the timer when all questions are answered.

Once quiz is completed, the user will be presented with their score and an opportunity to input their initials. After clicking the submit button, this score and their initials will be loaded onto a local storage connected to the "View Highscores" HTML in which the user can see their score and initials are now on the highscores page.
